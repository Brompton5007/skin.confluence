Nexus skining engine compatability.
with (Bossanova808's) AU weather.
Designed to enable better trackpad and keyboard navigation. (Ergonomic and styling changes to reduce the distance users need to move the pointer to navigate).
Music Artist Slides Shows, (Gade's) Tempo control all working. 
Home screen navigation improved Search, Power and Favorites buttons: now located next to central horizontal navigation menus.
Abreviated weather and clock dialogs enlarged on Homescreen. Home screen reserved areas :100p top (for clock and weather) :50p at bottom (enlarged RSS dialog) maintained to prevent dialog overlaps. 
New Backrounds: TV: (Test pattern), RADIO: (AU Radio dial), Settings: (Snowy Power control room), HOME: (charcoal drawing Brompton Gasworks). 
The idea of this Branch will be to  eventually suggest of the universalisable changes to the Master, (particularly the changes to enable better trackpad/keyboard navigation). I realise that this collection of files is not there yet, extranious notes in the  xml's make comparisions between branches difficult: but I put this up as a demonstration as to where the iterative process might be continued).
As things currently stand this is working quite solidly in Nexus. My apologies to non-AU users that AU weather has been incorporated into the central XML reservoir and not as distinct additions. But here I am incorporating the work of Bossanova808.
